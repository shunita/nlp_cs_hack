# NLP for Hackathons
These code examples are part of a workshop given as preparation for the Technion CS hackathon 2024.
Workshop slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12aaUNsoWUaTV7IZYpc0VA0ehoZctxcdmKr0DzM53tis/edit?usp=sharing).
The examples and slides show basic usage of huggingface models, and are designed for people without previous experience in NLP, but with some programming experience.

The examples contain a mental health chatbot using serverless access to huggingface models (chatbot_example.py), a grammar correction model using a downloaded huggingface model (grammar_correction_example.py), 
and a basic usage of openAI API (openai_example.py).
